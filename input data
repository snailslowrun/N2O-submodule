Table S4 provides an overview of these input data sources for the Melk and Zaya catchments.
The detailed input information on the soil classes are provided in Table S1-S2. Sta-tions for measuring climate data are listed in Table S5.
For the land use map, to simplify the representation of crops in the SWAT model, the crops in the INSPIRE land use map were grouped according to similar crop types and management. For example, winter wheat representation in SWAT was the crop category that contains the following crops: winter rye, winter barley, winter triticale, winter spelt, winter rapeseed and winter oats (Tables S6, S7, and S8). The land use map with the grouped crops from INSPIRE in 2017 was applied to the SWAT model. 
The INSPIRE crop data contains information on agricultural land use only, there-fore, the CORINE data was used to fill in the land cover in the catchments (Table S4). The final land use/land cover map applied to SWAT included information on specific crops, forest and urban areas (Figure 1) and it remained static for each year simulated.
Obtaining the types and amounts that farmers apply to their crops in the catch-ments for each year is almost impossible. Statistics are collected every 5 years at the district level [42], and guidelines are provided to farmers on fertilization regimes based on their soil nutrient levels [43], as well as subsidy programs exist in which farmers can obtain payments by adhering to the regulations [44]. Using this infor-mation, the SWAT model in the Melk catchment was setup with two N fertilizer input data (Table 2). This was undertaken to examine uncertainties in the N fertilizer data input and the impact on the resulting simulated N2O emissions.
